Legion Launcher - README
Overview:

Legion Launcher is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently manage and launch multiple programs at once. The application allows users to create, edit, and store multiple "profiles," each containing a list of executable programs. With Legion Launcher, users can easily select a profile and launch all associated programs with a single click.

The user interface is simple and intuitive, featuring a menu bar for profile management (create and edit profiles), a profile list, and options to launch programs associated with selected profiles. The program allows for flexibility by letting users add programs to profiles and launch them directly from the application.


**Features:**

Create Profiles: Save a group of programs under a custom profile name.
Edit Profiles: Modify existing profiles by adding programs.
Launch Profiles: Load and launch all programs within a selected profile with a single click.
List Profiles: View all available profiles stored in the application.
View Profile Contents: See a list of programs stored within a selected profile.
The logo of the application was created with the help of AI tools to bring a unique, modern touch to the interface.
